*Abstract*
\newline

There is a growing need for spatially explicit, high-resolution, biomass 
predictions as federal, state, and international agencies look to forest
to offset economy-wide emissions. 
Optical satellite imagery, like Landsat, offers historically consistent data 
with wide spatial coverage, and has been relied upon as the primary information
source in many biomass mapping and modeling efforts.
However, Landsat based models are not without significant errors. 
In this report, I attempted to leverage the spatial relationships between 
Landsat-based model residuals at federally maintained Forest Inventory and 
Analysis plot locations to improve model predictions in New York State.
I used variogram models and ordinary kriging to produce predictions of 
residuals which were then added back to initial model predictions.
These improved predictions were assessed against ground truth data and compared
to original model predictions at a set of holdout plots.
Additionally, I demonstrated how cross-validation paired with a grid-search
can be an effective method to produce variogram parameters.
Neither manually fit variograms, and cross-validation fit variograms were able
to meaningfully improve model predictions at FIA plot locations.

*Introduction*
\newline

Forest mapping and monitoring is becoming increasingly important as
federal, state, and global agencies look towards natural solutions
to mitigate a warming climate and the myriad resulting challenges. 
Field sampling programs, 
like the United States Department of Agriculture's Forest Inventory and Analysis
program (FIA) [@Gray2012],
provide unbiased estimates of forest structure over large areas, 
but lack the fine spatial resolution to understand and manage forests at 
relevant scales.
Thus, high-resolution forest mapping is needed to inform decision-makers where 
forest resources should be managed or preserved.
New York State in particular has mandated that they reach net-zero emissions 
across the entire economy by the year 2050, and they are actively researching
carbon benefits that their forests, which dominate 60% of the statewide 
landscape, can offer. 

Since the United States Geological Survey (USGS) opened the Landsat data 
archive in 2008, there has been an explosion of terrestrial monitoring 
approaches built with these freely available global datasets 
[@Wulder2012; @Banskota2014].
Landsat offers the longest history of publicly available remote sensing data,
from 1972 to present day, and has repeat observations for the same location
roughly twice a month.
These data are available everywhere, and Landsat missions are well supported
meaning that any methods developed now can likely applied for future monitoring.
Given the availability, moderate resolution (30m), temporal density, 
and global spatial coverage of Landsat data, many researchers
have explored their utility for mapping and monitoring forest conditions 
over large scales and long time periods. 
Landsat forestry applications include forest cover or species mapping, 
disturbance mapping, and biophysical 
(e.g. basal area, biomass, and canopy height) mapping [@Banskota2014].

While the benefits of Landsat imagery in terms of coverage and availability 
are well documented, 
it is also well known that they cannot predict forest structure as accurately
as active remote sensing data like LiDAR [@Huang2019; @Hurtt2019; @Chen2016].
Landsat-based models inherently rely on measures of spectral reflectance
or 'greenness' to predict forest structure. 
This is challenging in that vegetation near the ground floor can and does
appear quite green, and at a certain point more mature forests reach a greenness
saturation point after which biomass, basal area, or height growth may still
proceed without changes in spectral reflectance.
This inherent limitation in Landsat's ability to model forest structure leads
to less accurate spatial predictions of biomass and carbon which can have 
large impacts on greenhouse gas budgets that rely on mapped predictions. 
Landsat-based model predictions have been shown to be more accurate when 
aggregated to larger scales [@Riemann2010], however accurate predictions
at smaller scales will open the door to more targeted management 
(e.g. private land parcel, individual forest stands) for improved forest 
management. 

Regression kriging, or kriging of model residuals, is an approach that has
been previously documented to improve spatial predictions of forest 
structure which rely on both optical and radar satellite imagery 
[@Hudak2002; @Meng2009; @Tsui2013]. 
In this report I assessed the benefit of regression kriging to improve 
Landsat-based model predictions of forest aboveground biomass (AGB) across New
York State (NYS).
I examined first order effects effects of model residuals, fit variograms to the
residuals, and spatially interpolated them using ordinary kriging. 
I created enhanced predictions at a set of holdout FIA plots by adding the 
kriged residual prediction to the original prediction.
More accurate spatial predictions of AGB can help NYS target areas for increased
forest management with the goal of improved carbon sequestration and avoided
carbon emissions to help achieve netzero emissions in NYS by 2050. 
\newline

\noindent 
*Literature Review*
\newline

Several previous studies have explored the efficacy of spatial interpolation 
for mapping components of forest structure like mean biomass per unit area,
canopy height, and basal area. 
Two of such studies compared aspatial regression and machine learning (ML) 
methods to spatial interpolation methods in the form of ordinary kriging, 
co-kriging, and regression kriging [@Hudak2002; @Freeman2006]. 
@Hudak2002 showed that aspatial methods, models based on Landsat-derived
predictors, better maintained the pattern of vegetation across the study area 
while the spatial methods were less biased when producing maps of forest canopy 
height in a 200 km$^2$ research forest in western Oregon.
@Hudak2002 categorized regression kriging as an 'integrated' approach in that
the primary models relying on Landsat information are aspatial, and then 
the spatial relationships among the model residuals are used to improve the 
predictions. 
The integrated approach was better than the strictly spatial or aspatial 
approaches in that predictions had low bias and while the maps captured the
spatial pattern of the vegetation. 
@Freeman2006 produced similar comparisons between spatial and aspatial methods, 
but over a much larger study area covering the entire Rocky Mountain region
(RMR).
This region was broken up into 18 zones based on ecological similarity 
[@homer2001] to reduce the effects of trend across the RMR. 
Despite these efforts, they found that their aspatial model built with 
MODIS-derived predictors, was much better than the aspatial methods, and
regression kriging did little to improve the aspatial model predictions. 
They attribute these outcomes to the fact that the aspatial model already 
incorporated much of the spatial pattern in the landscape through the 
MODIS and environmental predictor layers built into the model. 

Additionally, two other studies compared various kriging approaches to 
each other.
@Tsui2013 used synthetic aperture radar (SAR) as auxiliary information to 
estimate AGB across a 25 km$^2$ area in Vancouver Island, Canada, 
while @Meng2009 used Landsat imagery as auxiliary information to estimate
pine basal area across 20 counties in Georgia, United States. 
@Tsui2013 showed that regression kriging was more accurate in terms of 
root mean squared error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) than all other
kriging approaches (ordinary kriging, co-kriging, regression co-kriging). 
@Meng2009 showed that regression kriging was superior to ordinary kriging and 
co-kriging in terms of R$^2$. 

Three out of the four studies here showed that regression kriging produced the
best results among spatial and aspatial approaches, however each of these 
three studies operated on much smaller scales 
(25 km$^2$, 250 km$^2$, ~35,000 km$^2$) than the ~141,000 km$^2$ in NYS. 
The @Freeman2006 study, the one study listed here where regression kriging was 
not the best approach, operated on a much larger area than NYS, but broke the
region up into smaller units. 
Additionally, this study noted that the scale of variation in the mountainous
RMR was smaller than the distance between reference FIA plots leading to a 
high nugget effect for the spatial approaches. \newline

*Study Area*
\newline

The study area for this report was all of NYS (Figure \@ref(fig:aoi)), 
spanning
`r prettyNum(units::drop_units(round(measurements::conv_unit(sf::st_read(here("data/nys_shape/Counties_Shoreline.shp")) |> sf::st_union() |> sf::st_area(), "m", "km"), 100000)), big.mark = ",", scientific = F)`
km$^2$, and
`r st_read(here("data/nys_shape/Counties_Shoreline.shp")) |> nrow()`
counties.
The topography across the state varies from 0m above sea level to roughly 
1,650m above sea level in the Adirondack region in the northern portion
of the state. 
Roughly 60% of the state is forested, and this forested land is dominated by
the maple, beech, birch forest type (53%), and is mostly privately owned (76%) 
[@dec].

```

\noindent 
*Datasets*
\newline

Estimates of AGB for all trees measuring $\geq$ 12.7 cm (5 in) diameter at 
breast height were produced as part of the USDA FIA program [@Gray2012], 
with true plot centroid locations obtained under agreement with the USDA. 
Estimates were recorded in pounds, then summed at each plot and area-normalized 
to units of megagrams per hectare (Mg ha^-1^). 
The plots are sampled on a hexagonal grid, with random offsets within each 
hexagon, such that one plot is sampled roughly every 2,400 ha (~6000 acres), 
however only one fifth of the plots are sampled in each year [@Bechtold2005]. 
For the purposes of this study, plots inventoried in 2019, the most recent
inventory that is publicly available, were used to limit processing time, and to
produce temporally coherent results. 
This field data was partitioned into a roughly 70% training dataset
(`r read.csv(here("data/training.csv")) |> filter(year == 2019) |> nrow()` 
plots), 
while the remaining 30% of the plots were set aside as a testing dataset
(`r read.csv(here("data/testing.csv")) |> filter(year == 2019) |> nrow()` 
plots).
The min, max, and average distances between plots are recorded in Table \@ref(tab:distp). 

The modelling approach used to produce model residuals for this study closely 
followed the approach developed by @Hudak2020. 
A set of 20 predictors were derived from Landsat analysis ready data 
[@Dwyer2018], 
Landtrendr derived disturbance and temporal segmentation information 
[@Kennedy2018],
a global forest canopy height layer [@Simard2011],
topographic data [@terrainr], 
climate data [@Daly2008], 
and land cover classifications [@Brown2020; @Zhu2014].
Three (ML) models were fit to a randomly selected 70% 
of the training dataset.
Random forest models (ranger, @Wright2017), 
stochastic gradient boosting machines (lightgbm, @Guolin2021), 
and support vector machines (kernlab,  @Alexandros2004)
were developed. 
With these 3 component models, we developed a "stacked" linear model ensemble 
model (hereafter LINMOD) in effort to reduce the generalization error of our 
component models [@Wolpert1992]. 
LINMOD was developed by regressing the component model predictions for the
30% of the training data not used to train the component models against the 
observed values. 

LINMOD was then used to make predictions for 30m pixels across the entire state.
To produce plot-level residuals, pixel predictions were summarized at the 
training plot locations as well as the testing plot locations by taking the 
weighted average of pixels that intersected each plot. 
Residuals were computed by subtracting reference AGB value from the model 
prediction such that positive residuals represent overpredictions and negative
residuals represent underpredictions.

*Methods and Results*
\newline

First I examined the first order effects of the data to identify any global
trends or directional patterns in the data. 
Before attempting to visualize the data spatiall, I produced a histogram of
the training data residuals (Figure \@ref(fig:trainhist)). 
The histogram of the residuals indicated that the data was roughly normally
distributed and centered on 0, which is perhaps unsurprising given that the
the atttributes are model residuals which ideally have a mean of 0. 
The data is slightly skewed left, with a few large negative residuals near
200 Mg ha$^-1$. 
For the sake of mapping firest order effects, I interpreted these residuals as 
outliers, and the color scale range was restricted to 
$[-max(residual), max(residual)]$
such that these large negative outliers were included, but the color scale
was not shifted drastically due to their inclusion. 

```{r trainhist, echo = FALSE, fig.cap="Histogram for initial model residuals at training data locations. 25 bins used.", fig.align="center", out.width = "100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("figures/train_hist.png"))
```

To visualize the first order effects spatially, I plotted a continuous point
kernel function which estimates local means where attributes are weighted by 
their distance from the estimation location. 
The continuous point kernel estimates are computed as follows:

\begin{equation}
\hat{\mu_\tau}(s) = \sum_{i=1}^{n}w_i(s)y_i (\#eq:kernavg)
\end{equation} 

\noindent
Where $\hat{\mu_\tau}(s)$ is the average estimate for location s, n is the 
number of points within a distance $\tau$ of location s, $w_i$ is the weight
for point $i$ and $y_i$ is the attribute value for point $i$. 
$w_i$ is computed as follows:

\begin{equation}
w_i(s) =  \frac{k(\frac{(s - s_i)}{\tau})}{\sum_{j=1}^{n}k(\frac{(s - s_j)}{\tau})} (\#eq:wkern)
\end{equation} 

\noindent
Where k is computed as follows:

\begin{equation}
k = \frac{3}{\pi \tau^2}(1 - \frac{h^2}{\tau^2})^2 (\#eq:kern)
\end{equation}

\noindent
Where h is the distance between two locations. 
I chose a bandwidth of 250km and uniformly spaced kernels 5km apart to produce
a smooth surface with acceptable resolution. 
For the color scale I chose even intervals with $1 + 3.3 log(n)$ classes, 
centered on 0. 
The range was trimmed as mentioned above. 

The plotted continuous point kernel surface (Figure \@ref(fig:kernelplot))
does not show any identifiable trends or directional components. 
Rather, the spatial arrangement of residuals seems random, with underpredictions
and overpredictions not following any strong spatial pattern.
This can be interpreted in two different ways. 
First, we might conclude that the environmental and spatial variables used as
predictors in the model were able to capture any large scale trends in 
biomass across the state. 
Alternatively, if we assume that biomass is "randomly" distributed across the
state, then since these residuals are partly a function of the measured biomass 
on the ground, it would follow that the residuals themselves are randomly 
distributed. 
We do know that there are large concentrations of forest in the Adirondack and 
Catskill regions, however most of the state is dominated by patchy forest 
cover. 


```{r kernelplot, echo = FALSE, out.width='100%', fig.cap="Continuous point kernel estimates for training data; Bandwidth = 25 km; Kernels uniformly spaced 5 km apart.", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("figures/train_kernel.png"))
```

Next, I explored variograms to identify the second order effects of the data
with the goal of leveraging the spatial dependence of the residual values
to do spatial interpolation. 
Specifically, variograms help identify the way the attribute deviations
covary across the state. 
The results of the continuous point kernel analysis led to the use of a single
omnidirectional variogram for the entire region. 
The variogram estimates for a given lag are computed as follows: 

\begin{equation}
\hat{\gamma}(h) = \frac{1}{2n(h)}\sum_{h = s_i - s_j}(y_i - y_j)^2 (\#eq:var)
\end{equation} 

\noindent
Where h represents a lag distance between two locations $s_i$ and $s_j$, 
$n$ is the number of points that have a distance smaller than lag $h$, and 
$y_i$, $y_j$ are the attribute values at locations $i$ and $j$ respectively. 

First I plotted the variogram estimates using the training data and 700 
equally spaced lag distances (Figure \@ref(fig:vgram)).
Additionally I plotted the variogram cloud (Figure \@ref(fig:vgramcloud)) where
instead of the average pairwise relationship at each lag, 
each individual pairwise relationship is plotted at each lag. 
I limited the variogram and variogram cloud plots to lags $\leq$ 50 km 
which omitted a good portion of the statewide data which contains distances
up to roughly ~600 km (Table \@ref(tab:distp)). 
We don't expect forest conditions at one end of the state to have any 
influence on forest condiations at the other end of the state. 
Moreover, the forest conditions in NYS are quite patchy which is reflective 
of the majority privately owned forest lands in the state (*Datasets section). 
This is not uncommon in the northeastern United States, 
but is much different than the West where large swaths of forest are maintained
on public lands.
The 50 km is likely still generous outside of the Adirondack or Catskill region
in the state, but allows us to focus on the covariance at smaller lag distances.
The variogram cloud helps make sense of the variogram estimates, particularly 
in the presence of noise. 
In this case it confirms the pattern in the variogram, reflecting smaller 
variances at the smallest lag distances.

```{r vgram, echo = FALSE, out.width='100%', fig.cap="Estimated variogram plot from training data, with CV fit variogram and manual fit variogram overlaid.", fig.align="center"}

```

```{r vgramcloud, echo = FALSE, out.width='100%', fig.cap="Variogram cloud from training data.", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("figures/variogram_cloud.png"))
```


Using the estimated variogram plot as reference I manually fit a variogram model
to the estimated variogram points. The two variogram models that I tested were a
spherical model defined as:

\begin{equation}
\hat{\gamma}(h) = \left\{
     \begin{array}{lr}
       s^2(\frac{2h}{2r}-\frac{h^3}{2r^3} : h \leq r) \\
       s^2 :                                otherwise
     \end{array}
   \right.\\ (\#eq:sphere)
\end{equation} 

\noindent
And an exponential model defined as: 
\begin{equation}
\hat{\gamma}(h) = \left\{
        \begin{array}{lr}
        a + ((s - a) (1 - e^{-3h/r})) : h > 0 \\
        0 : h == 0
    \end{array}
   \right.\\ (\#eq:exp)
\end{equation} 

\noindent
where $h$ is the the lag distance between points, $a$ is the nugget, 
$r$ is the range, and $s$ is the sill. 

The parameters chosen for the manually fit variogram model can be seen in 
Table \@ref(tab:vgramtab), and the fit is exhibited by the blue curve in
Figure \@ref(fig:vgram). 
Additionally, I performed a standard grid search across the four variogram
parameters (sill, range, nugget, model type) and assessed each using k-fold 
cross-validation with 10 folds.
The assessment was performed using ordinary kriging (described subsequently),
and the performance was assessed by computing the root mean squared error
(RMSE; calculation described subsequently) of the kriged predictions of 
residuals compared against the actual residuals.
For each unique combination of variogram parameters, the training data 
was split into 10 folds. 
For the kth iteration of the cross validation, the kth fold of the data was
held out, and the k-1 other folds were used for training. 
In other words the k-1 other folds were used to compute the covariance matrix
used for making kriging predictions. 
Predictions are made for the kth fold and those predictions are compared to 
the actual values. 
The RMSEs produced for each of the 10 iterations was averaged to produce a 
single RMSE value for each unique set of variogram parameters. 
I used the plotted variogram estimates (Figure \@ref(fig:vgram)) to determine
suitable ranges for each of the variogram parameters which are described in
Table \@ref(tab:vgramsearch).
These combinations were sorted by their associated RMSE values, and the 
combination with the lowest RMSE was selected. 
This best combination of paramters is described in Table \@ref(tab:vgramtab),
and the fit is shown by the red line in Figure \@ref(fig:vgram). 
The CV RMSE produced by the various parameter combinations ranged from a low of
of
`r format(round(min(read.csv(here::here("data/cv_variogram_params.csv"))$X1), 2), big.mark = ",", scientific = FALSE)` 
AGB Mg ha$^-1$ (selected iteration), to a high of
`r format(round(max(read.csv(here::here("data/cv_variogram_params.csv"))$X1), 2), big.mark = ",", scientific = FALSE)` 
AGB Mg ha$^-1$.

```

I used ordinary kriging to produce prediction surfaces across the state, and to
produce point predictions at the testing data locations.
Kriging estimates for a location $s0$ were computed as follows:

\begin{equation}
\hat{Y}(s_0) = \sum_{i=1}^{n}w_iY(s_i) (\#eq:okrig)
\end{equation} 

\noindent
Where $Y(s_i)$ is the value for sampled (member of training data set) location 
$i$ and $w_i$ is a corresponding weight computed as follows: 

\begin{equation}
w_+(s) = C_+^{-1}c_+(s) (\#eq:wokrig)
\end{equation} 

\noindent
Where $C_+^{-1}$ is the inverse covariance matrix computed with the provided 
variogram model and the sampled locations with an additional column and row of 
all ones appended. 
The last value in the diagonal (first is top left, last is bottom right) is set
to 0. 
These modifications enforce that weights $w$ sum to 1. 
$c_+$ is a vector containing covariance between the estimated location $s$ 
and the sampled points, with a 1 appended to enforce weights $w$ sum to 1.
The $+$ subscript for w, represents the presence of the "lagrange multiplier" in 
the $w$ vector, which is not used practically but is used in computation to 
force the sum of the weights to equal 1. 
The variance of each kriging prediction is computed as follows:

\begin{equation}
\sigma_e^2 = \sigma^2 - c_+^T(s)C_+^{-1}c_+(s) (\#eq:varokrig)
\end{equation} 

\noindent
Where $\sigma^2$ is the sill parameter. 

The kriging surfaces produced with both variograms is displayed in 
Figure \@ref(fig:krigpred) and the associated variance surfaces are displayed in 
Figure \@ref(fig:krigvar). 
The kriging predictions from both variograms seem to correctly capture the range
of residuals as present in the training data.
Notably, the manually fit variogram predictions are less conservative, in that
there are more predictions further from 0 (or the near-zero average residual),
as evidenced by the less proportion of white space in the manual variogram 
kriging prediction map.
This is likely a function of the larger range parameter chosen for the manually
fit variogram (Table \@ref(tab:vgramtab)).
The variance surface (Figure \@ref(fig:krigvar)) shows how quickly the
uncertainty of the kriged predictions grows as we move away from plot locations,
as we can assume the dots or pockets of lower variance are plot locations. 
Displaying a similar pattern to the prediction surface, the variance of the
CV fit variogram rises much faster as distances from the inferred plot locations
increases. 
In both cases, we can say that the predictions are not very accurate with 
any significant distance from plot locations, but this plays out more strongly
with the CV fit variogram predictions.
Finally, the maximum variance produced by the CV fit variogram predictions are
much larger than the manually fit variogram predictions due to the differences
in the selected sill parameters.

```

Both the CV fit variogram and the manually fit variogram were used to make 
predictions at the testing data locations (displayed by the black points in
Figures \@ref(fig:krigvar), \@ref(fig:krigpred)). 
The residuals predicted at these locations were subtracted from the original
model predictions at these locations to create new "improved" estimates. 
The new estimates, as well as the original estimates, were compared to the
FIA AGB values.
RMSE (Equation \@ref(eq:rmse)), mean bias error (MBE; Equation \@ref(eq:mbe)), 
and the coefficient of determination (R$^2$; Equation \@ref (eq:r2)) were
computed for the three sets of predictions 
(original, CV fit predictions, and manual predictions). 
These three performance metrics were computed as follows:

\begin{equation}
\operatorname{RMSE} = \sqrt{(\frac{1}{n})\sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_{i} - \hat{y_{i}})^{2}} (\#eq:rmse)
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\operatorname{MBE} = (\frac{1}{n})\sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_{i} - \hat{y_{i}}) (\#eq:mbe)
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\operatorname{R^2} = 1 - \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}\left(y_{i}-\hat{y}_{i}\right)^2}{\sum_{i=1}^{n}\left(y_i - \bar{y}\right)^2} (\#eq:r2)
\end{equation}

Where $n$ is the number of FIA plots included in the data set, $\hat{y_i}$ is 
the predicted value, $y_{i}$ the measured value at the corresponding 
location, and $\bar{y}$ the mean value from measurements or observations.

Differences between all three sets of predictions were marginal, however
the CV fit kriging predictions were the best in terms of RMSE, while 
the original (unimproved by kriging) predictions were distinctly better than
both kriging approaches in terms of MBE (Table \@ref(tab:perftab)).
Interestingly, the CV fit approach had marginally worse MBE compared to the 
manually fit predictions, despite producing a better RMSE. 
Additionally, each of the three sets of predictions were plotted against the
FIA reference values and a 1 to 1 line was overlaid 
(Figure \@ref(fig:perfscatter)).
In most cases, all three predictions are very similar which further reinforces
the comparison of accuracy metrics in Table \@ref(tab:perftab). 
The general pattern across all three sets of predictions is overprediction
on the low end of the reference AGB distribution and underprediction on the 
high end of reference AGB distribution.
In other words the predictions are biased towards the mean. 
This is undoubtedly a function of the model itself rather than the spatial 
interpolation process given the similarity of the kriging predictions to the
model predictions. 
The increased size of the bias (more negative) in the kriging improved 
predictions might be better understood by the kriging prediction surfaces which 
are dominated by positive residuals (blue in Figure \@ref(fig:krigpred)). 
Positive predicted residuals would result in decreased predictions after 
subtracting the residuals.
It is possible that the abundance of overpredictions on reference locations
with 0 AGB (see the Y-Axis of Figure \@ref(fig:perfscatter)) in the original
model predictions led to the overabundance of positive residuals in the 
predicted surface and the predictions at the testing locations.

```

Overall, regression kriging with both variogram fitting approaches did little to
improve the model predictions at the testing locations. 
This is likely due to weak spatial relationship between residuals at 
FIA plot locations as evidenced by the small range in variance in the 
variogram estimate plot (Figure \@ref(fig:vgram)). 
Perhaps more importantly, the range of the variograms, or rather the distances
at which information could be gathered from other locations was quite short
(Table \@ref(tab:vgramtab)), compared to the average distance between plots 
(Table \@ref(tab:distp)). 
As evidenced by the prediction surface (Figure \@ref(fig:krigpred)), very 
conservative (near-zero) predictions are made with any signficant distance
from the original training plots, and it is rare that the testing plot 
locations fell close enough to a training plot for the prediction there to 
be significantly improved.

*Conclusions*
\newline

This report showed that regression kriging did little to improve landsat-based
AGB model predictions at FIA plots inventoried in 2019 throughout NYS. 
The spatial relationships of the model residuals are not generalizable beyond
very short distances, and the spacing of FIA plots does not support the transfer
of information from plot to plot. 
Additionally, we might conclude that the model residuals are mostly randomly 
distributed in space, 
indicating that the models are properly calibrated.
While this is good news for the models themselves, it certainly does not help
the kriging process. 
For this approach to be more effective we might require a more intensive 
sampling protocol, or rather a random sample instead of a systematic one 
to create a wider range of plot-to-plot distances that could be leveraged
for spatial interpolation.
I was able to demonstrate that a grid search with k-fold cross-validation 
produced a better variogram fit than what a human practitioner 
invested in the outcome could produce, as evidenced by the marginally improved 
kriging predictions for the CV fit variogram.

*Future Work*
\newline

This approach might benefit from breaking down the study area into smaller
units or homogeneous blocks to promote covariance between plots.
Eco-regions might be suitable for this approach, however care would need to be
taken to ensure that a sufficient number of observations were present in 
each unit. 
Additionally, this work could be extended by including all five annual sampling
frames to include the full inventory of NYS plots. 
Plots inventoried from 2019 were selected in this study for efficiency gains 
and temporal consistency in the results, but the kriging process might benefit
from a more dense set of observations. 
Finally, this approach might be more successful if individual FIA subplots
were treated as individual units, thus allowing for more fine-scale spatial 
relationships in the data.
From the outset of our modeling approach we treated the aggregate of the 4 
subplots as a single unit, trading smaller sample size for more information at
each unit and a reduction in plot-level AGB variance. 
In this case a residual produced at the subplot was incongruous with our 
model design.
